Hi! Thanks for checking out the program.

I created a script to find a square root of the desired number, and then to illustrate the algorithim.
To run it, just install matplotlib by running: 'pip install matplotlib', and intall time: 'pip install time'.

The algorithim I used is not mine for it was created by the babylonians when they did it by hand.
It works by starting out with a guess. For my program the guess is just the radican divided by 10.
Then, the method is to check the guess by running: Radican/Guess. If the Radican/Guess = Guess, the guess is correct and that is the root.
If not, the program takes the average of the Radican/Guess, and the Guess.
This value is the new guess and the program repeats until it converges on the answer.

Note: This is accurate to up to 5 decimal places; I did this for time efficiency as doing more would make the program iterate a lot more.

I illustrated this using a package called matplotlib and used arrows to point towards all of the guesses, radican/guesses, and averages.


Thanks,
